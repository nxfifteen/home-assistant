## Hardware and general setup

For my setup I use an old Lenovo Yoga Pro 2, it has a touch screen so I have mounted it on the wall by the front door so I can easily access some controls in my Lovelace UI.

OS | Ubuntu desktop 18.04
-- | --
SSD | 512GB
RAM | 8GB
Processor | Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-4500U Processor
Connectivity | WiFi

For the installation method of Home Assistant I went with [the generic Linux installation of Hassio](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/#alternative-install-on-a-generic-linux-host)

This method stores the files used by hassio/Home Assistant in `/usr/share/hassio`.

I have mounted a share from my NAS to the `/usr/share/hassio` dir, that way I can handle backups and replication on my NAS.

For my theme I use [slate](https://github.com/seangreen2/slate_theme) on all my devices for two reasons, it looks good and I can track it in HACS.

To access my instance I'm using my [Nabu Casa ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://www.nabucasa.com/) link.
