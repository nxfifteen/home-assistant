# Hello there! üëã

So this is my Home Assistant instance üéâ

This repository exists mostly for my own amusement, but it may contain some things that others might find useful.

## Statistics from the instance

Description | Value

{%- set data = namespace(domains=[]) %}
{%- for state in states %}
{%- if state.domain not in data.domains %}
{%- set data.domains = data.domains + [state.domain] %}
{%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}
{%- for domain in data.domains %}
Entities in the [`{{domain}}`](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/{{domain}}) domain | {{states[domain] | count }}
{%- endfor %}

## Hardware and general setup

For my setup I use an old Lenovo Yoga Pro 2, it has a touch screen so I have mounted it on the wall by the front door so I can easily access some controls in my Lovelace UI.

OS | Ubuntu desktop 18.04
-- | --
SSD | 512GB
RAM | 8GB
Processor | Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-4500U Processor
Connectivity | WiFi

For the installation method of Home Assistant I went with [the generic Linux installation of Hassio](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/#alternative-install-on-a-generic-linux-host)

This method stores the files used by hassio/Home Assistant in `/usr/share/hassio`.

I have mounted a share from my NAS to the `/usr/share/hassio` dir, that way I can handle backups and replication on my NAS.

For my theme I use [slate](https://github.com/seangreen2/slate_theme) on all my devices for two reasons, it looks good and I can track it in HACS.

To access my instance I'm using my [Nabu Casa ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://www.nabucasa.com/) link.

## Custom Lovelace plugins that I use

A summary of custom Lovelace plugins that I use.

### [Compact Custom Header](https://github.com/maykar/compact-custom-header)

_CCH - Customize the header and add enhancements to Lovelace. Features: kiosk mode, conditional header styling, per user/device views, swiping between views on mobile, and more._

I use this to get more screen space by minifying the space used by the header, and to lock my laptop that I have in the hallway by the door to one view.

### [Favicon Counter](https://github.com/custom-cards/favicon-counter)

_Show a notification count badge.._

I use this to show a badge on the Home Assistant tab in my browser when there are active [Persistent notifications](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/persistent_notification/)

### [Mini Graph Card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card)

_Minimalistic graph card for Home Assistant Lovelace UI_

I use this to create beautiful statistics cards for my UI.

***

Like all other Home Assistant instances this is also a Work in Progress :D
